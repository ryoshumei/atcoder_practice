# Viewing Hidden Files and Directories

The `.idea` folder is not visible because it's a hidden folder (it starts with a dot). This is a standard Unix convention where any file or directory that begins with a dot (.) is hidden by default.

## How to View Hidden Files

### macOS Finder
- Press `Command + Shift + .` (period) to toggle showing hidden files

### Windows Explorer
- Go to View tab → check "Hidden items" box

### Linux File Managers
- Press `Ctrl + H` in most file managers

### IDE Project View
- In JetBrains IDEs (like PyCharm), follow these steps to show hidden files:
  1. Open your project in the IDE
  2. Look for the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner of the Project view panel
  3. Click on the gear icon to open the options menu
  4. Uncheck the "Hide Dot Files" option in the dropdown menu
  
This will make all hidden files and folders (including the `.idea` directory) visible in your project structure.
